      <h1> Hello</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        My name is Davis Cook and I am a junior year computer science student
        here at Seton Hall. I am currently pursuing research on Text Analysis and
        Automated Coding. In my free time I enjoy learning new concepts related to
        programming, rock climbing, and relaxing with my friends. If you would like
        to connect with me on LinkedIn please click <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davis-cook/">
        here</a> and If you would like to see my work click

      <p>
        I'm not really sure what I want to put here. I am used to having 3 spaces
        but this made scaling really nice. Soooooooooo I hope you are enjoying my
        website. It took a lot of hard work, blood, sweat, and tears (minus the
        blood and the tears).
